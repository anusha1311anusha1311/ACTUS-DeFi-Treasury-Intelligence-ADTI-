# ACTUS-DeFi-Treasury-Intelligence-ADTI-
This proposal introduces Corporate Treasury 3.0, a standardized, contract-based treasury management framework for enterprises that integrates working capital (accounts receivable/payable), fiat cash, stablecoins, and yield-bearing digital assets into a single, auditable liquidity system using ACTUS financial contracts. 
Modern enterprises increasingly hold digital assets as strategic treasury instruments. By late 2025, over 140 public companies disclosed digital assets on balance sheets, with Bitcoin used as a long-term reserve hedge and Ethereum adopted for its staking yields (3–4%) and role in the tokenized asset economy. Regulatory clarity (FASB fair-value accounting), institutional access (spot ETFs), and operational integration (on-chain payments, settlement, and tokenized debt issuance) have accelerated this trend, enabling faster settlement and lower issuance and financing costs.
This solution leverages ACTUS deterministic cash flow algorithms with AI-driven risk modeling to help enterprises understand, quantify, and mitigate risks in hybrid portfolios spanning fiat, yield-bearing stablecoins, digital assets (BTC and ETH), and tokenized real-world assets. Addressing the $5.7T global SME finance gap, it enables real-time working capital optimization via regulated stablecoin settlement, reducing cash conversion cycles from days to minutes while providing comprehensive risk visibility.
However, current treasury systems treat receivables, payables, cash, hedges, and digital assets as fragmented objects. This proposal demonstrates how ACTUS standard contract types (PAM, FUTUR, CLM) can represent accounts receivable and payable as deterministic cash-flow contracts, fiat and stablecoin holdings as principal-at-maturity instruments, ETH staking as a time-bound, yield-bearing investment, and FX hedges and intercompany netting as portfolio-level events.
